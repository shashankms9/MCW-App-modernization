# Exercise 6: Using serverless Azure Functions to process orders

Duration: 30 minutes

With its migration to Azure, Parts Unlimited plans to launch a series of campaigns to increase its sales. Their current architecture is processing purchase orders synchronously and is coupled with their front end. Parts Unlimited is looking for ways to decouple its order processing system and make sure it can scale independently from the web front end when orders increase.

You suggest a serverless approach that can handle order processing and the creation of invoices for processed orders. In this exercise, you will deploy a serverless Azure Function that will listen to an Azure Storage Queue and process orders as they come. Parts Unlimited has already implemented the changes required to push the jobs into a queue of your choice.

## Task 1: Deploying Azure Functions


1. Select the Start menu and search for **Visual Studio Code**. Select **Visual Studio Code** to run it.

    ![Start Menu is open. Visual Studio Code is typed in the search box. Visual Studio Code is highlighted from the list of search results.](media/vscode-start-menu.png "Visual Studio Code")

## Task 3: Testing serverless order processing

In this task, we will submit a new order on the Parts Unlimited website and observe the order's processing on the order details page. Once the order is submitted, the web front-end will put a job into an Azure Storage Queue. The Function App that we previously deployed is set to listen to the queue and pull jobs for processing. Once order processing is done, a PDF file will be created, and the link for the PDF file will be accessible on the order details page.

1. Go back to the resource list and navigate to your **(2) partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
App Service resource. You can search for **(1)** `partsunlimited-web` to find your Web App and App Service Plan.

   ![The search box for the resource is filled in with partsunlimited-web. The partsunlimited-web-20 Azure App Service is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/resource-group-appservice-resource.png "Resources")

1. Select **URL** and navigate to the Parts Unlimited web site hosted in Azure App Service.

    ![Parts Unlimited App Service is on screen. URL is highlighted.](media/navigate-to-parts-unlimited-app-service.png "App Service Public Endpoint")

1. Select **Login (1)**. If a login wasn't created in the earlier exercise then select **Register as a new user? (2)**, otherwise skip to step 6 (login to the web site)

    ![Parts Unlimited web site login screen is presented. Log in and Register as a new user buttons are highlighted.](media/Register1.png "Parts Unlimited Login")

1. Type in `test@test.com` for the email **(1)** and `Password.1!!` **(2)** for the password. Select **Register (3)**.

    ![Parts Unlimited web site user registration screen is presented. Email box is filled with test@test.com. Password boxes are filled in with Password.1!!. The register button is highlighted.](media/Register2.png "Register")

1. On the next screen, select **Click here to confirm your email** to confirm your e-mail.

    - **Email (2):** test@test.com
    - **Password (3):** Password.1!!

    ![Parts Unlimited web site login screen is presented. Email box is filled with test@test.com. Password boxes are filled in with Password.1!!. Login button is highlighted. ](media/Register3.png "Login")

1. Select a product from the home page, and select **Add to Cart** once you are on the product detail page.

    ![Product detail page is shown. Add to cart button is highlighted.](media/Register4.png "Add to Cart")

1. Select **Checkout** on the next screen.

1. Once checkout is complete, select **view your order** to see order details.

    ![Checkout Complete page is shown. View your order link is highlighted.](media/Register6.1.png "View your order")

1. Observe the invoice field. Right now, your order is flagged as in processing. An order job is submitted to the Azure Storage Queue to be processed by Azure Functions. Refresh the page every 15 seconds to see if anything changes about your order.

    ![Order details page is open. Invoice field is highlighted.](media/Register6.2.png "Invoice processing")

1. Once your order has been processed, an invoice will be created, and a download link will appear. Select the download link to download the PDF invoice created for your order by Azure Functions.

    ![Order details page is open. Invoice field is highlighted to show a download link.](media/Register6.3.png "Invoice download")

    Here is your invoice.

    ![A sample Parts Unlimited Invoice is presented.](media/Register6.4.png "Sample Invoice")

## Task 4: Enable Application Insights on the Function App

In this task, you add Application Insights to your Function App in the Azure Portal, to be able to collect insights related to Function executions.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Function App** by selecting the **hands-on-lab-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
resource group, and selecting the **parts-func-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** App service from the list of resources.

   ![The Function App resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/azure-resources-function-app.png "Function App")

1. On the Function App blade, select **Application Insights (1)** under Settings from the left-hand menu. On the Application Insights blade, select **Turn on Application Insights (2)**.

   ![Application Insights blade is selected. The Turn on Application Insights button is highlighted.](media/function-app-add-app-insights.png "Turn on Application Insights for Function App")

1. On the Application Insights blade, provide the below information.

   - Select **Create new resource(1)**, accept the default resource name and location provided. 
   - Select existing log analytics workspace **parts-Workspace-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>(2)** workspace from the dropdown as shown in the below screenshot.
   - Click on **Apply(3)**, Select **Yes** when prompted about restarting the Function App to apply monitoring settings.

   ![The Create New Application Insights blade is displayed with a unique name set under Create new resource. Apply and the following Yes approval buttons are highlighted.](media/App-Mod-function-app.png "Add Application Insights")

1. After the Function App restarts, select **View Application Insights data**.

   ![The View Application Insights data link is highlighted.](media/App-Mod-app-insights.png "View Application Insights data")

1. On the Application Insights blade, select **Live Metrics (1)** under **Investigate** .

   ![Live Metrics Stream is highlighted in the left-hand menu on the Application Insights blade.](media/app-insights-live-metrics-stream.png "Application Insights")

   > It might take few minutes for the Live Metrics to get loaded, Refresh the Page to view the Live Metrics.
    
   > While having Live Metric up, try submitting a new order on the Parts Unlimited web site. You will see access to blob storage in the telemetry to upload the PDF **(2)** and execution count on the graph **(3)**.

## Summary
 
In this exercise you have covered the following:
  
   - Created an Azure Function app. 
   - Connected Azure Function app and App Service. Tested the serverless order processing in the application.
