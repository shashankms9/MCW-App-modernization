# Exercise 5: Setup CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for the web app

Duration: 55 minutes

In this exercise, you will move the codebase to a GitHub Repo, create a staging environment in Azure App Service using App Service Deployment Slots, and finally connect the pieces with a CI/CD Pipeline built on GitHub Actions.

### Task 1: Moving the codebase to a GitHub repo

1. Browse to `https://github.com` in your browser and log into your account.

   > NOTE!! If you don't have a GitHub account, then navigate to the following link ```https://github.com/join ``` and create one.
  
  1. Create a Personal Access Token as described below.

     - In the upper-right corner of your GitHub page, select your profile photo, then click **Settings**.

        ![](media/github-01.png)

     - From the left-hand side menu, select **Developer settings**.

         ![](media/github-devset.png)

     - Now, click **Personal access tokens (1)** dropdown and select **Tokens (classic) (2)**, click on **Generate new token (3)** button on the right and select **Generate new token (classic) (4)** from the list. Provide the GitHub password if prompted.

         ![](media/token.png)

     - Select the scopes or permissions you would like to grant this token.

        - Note: Enter **Auth-token** in the note field.

        - Select scopes: Select the following scopes when configuring your GitHub Personal Access Token

            - `repo` - Full control of private repositories

            - `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows

            - `write:packages` - Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry

            - `delete:packages` - Delete packages from GitHub Package Registry

              - `read:org` - Read org and team membership, read org projects

                 ![The configured scopes for a GitHub Personal Access Token.](media/github-04.png "GitHub Personal Access Token Scope Configuration")

        - Leave other values as default and select **Generate token**.

            ![](media/github-05.png)
  
 1. Click on the **Copy** icon to copy the token to your clipboard and save it on your notepad. For security reasons, after you get off the page, you will not be able to see the token again. **DO NOT COMMIT THIS TO YOUR REPO!**

    ![The GitHub Personal Access Token. This is a secret value that should be stored somewhere safe and accessible.](media/github-06.png "Created GitHub Personal Access Token")

 1. Select the New button positioned on the top of the repositories list. As an alternative, you can [navigate to the new repository site here](https://github.com/new).

    ![GitHub.com Landing page is shown. New button to create a new repository is highlighted.](media/updated71.png "GitHub new repo")

1. Type in `partsunlimited` **(1)** as your repository name. Select **Private (2)** to prevent public access to the repository. Select **Create repository (3)** to continue.

    ![Repository name is set to partsunlimited. Private access is selected. Create repository button is highlighted.](media/createrepo.png "Create a new repository")

1. Select the **clipboard copy command** to copy the Git endpoint for your repository and paste the value into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe, for later reference.

    ![GitHub repository page is shown. Endpoint copy to clipboard button is highlighted.](media/updated73.png "Repository endpoint")

   We will use the Lab VM to execute some development tasks.

1. Right-click on the Windows Start Menu and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** to launch a terminal window.

    ![Start Menu context menu is open. Windows PowerShell (Admin) command is highlighted.](media/launch-powershell.png "Windows PowerShell")

1. The Parts Unlimited website's source code is already copied into the VM as part of the **Before the hands-on lab exercises**. Run the command below to navigate to the source code folder.

    ```PowerShell
    cd "C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-microsoft-app-modernization-v2\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src"
    ```
1. Run the following command to initialize a local Git repository.

    ```PowerShell
    git init
    ```

    ![PowerShell terminal is shown. Git init is highlighted and executed.](media/updated74.png "Git init")

1. Next, we will define the remote endpoint as of an origin to our local repository. Replace `{YourEndpointURL}` with the endpoint URL you copied previously from GitHub. Run the final command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```PowerShell
    git remote add origin {YourEndpointURL}
    ```

    ![PowerShell terminal is shown. Git remote add origin is highlighted and executed. ](media/updated75.png "Git remote add")

1. Run the following commands to rename the current branch to **Main** and stage all the files for a git commit.

    ```PowerShell
    git branch -M main
    git add .
    ```

1. Before we commit our changes, we have to identify our git user name and e-mail. In the following command, replace `John Doe` with your name and `johndoe@example.com` with your e-mail address. Once ready, run the command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```PowerShell
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```

1. We are ready to commit the source code to our local Git repository. Run the following command to continue.

    ```PowerShell
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    ```

1. Let's push our code to GitHub. Run the following command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```PowerShell
    git push -u origin main
    ```

1. The GitHub authentication screen will pop up. Provide a **Personal Access Token** that you noted earlier and click on **Sign in**.

    > **NOTE**: Sometimes an authentication screen might not pop up, instead it might ask you to enter your credentials on PowerShell itself.   
      
     > Fill in your GitHub account with the following details to sign in from PowerShell.
      
     > - **Username:** Enter your GitHub Username
     > - **Password:** Paste the **Personal Access Token** that you copied earlier in Step 3.

1. Go back to GitHub and observe the repository with the source code uploaded.

    git push 
    ```

14. In GitHub, select **Actions**. The workflow will display as in progress.

    ![The GitHub action workflow displays as being in progress.](media/updated88.png "Workflow in progress")

15. Go back to your lab resource group on the Azure Portal, and navigate to your `staging (partsunlimited-web-/staging)` **(2)** App Service resource. You can search for `staging` **(1)** to find your App Service (Slot) for staging.

    ![The search box for resources is filled in with staging. The staging (partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}/staging) Azure App Service Deployment Slot is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/updated89.png "Staging Resource")

16. Notice the dedicated web link for your staging slot. Select to navigate to the website to see the result of your successful deployment through the CI/CD pipeline.

    ![Staging slot for partsunlimited app service is open. URL endpoint for the deployment slot is highlighted.](media/appmod-ex5-t3-s16.png "Staging public endpoint")

### Task 4: Pushing code changes to staging and production

1. Select the Start menu and search for **Visual Studio Code**. Select **Visual Studio Code** to run it.

    ![Start Menu is open. Visual Studio Code is typed in the search box. Visual Studio Code is highlighted from the list of search results.](media/vscode-start-menu.png "Visual Studio Code")

2. Open the **File (1)** menu and select **Open Folder... (2)**.

    ![File menu is open in Visual Studio Code. Open Folder... command is highlighted.](media/vscode-open-folder.png "Open Folder")

3. Navigate to `C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-microsoft-app-modernization-v2\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src` and select **Select Folder (1)**.

    ![Visual Studio Code Open Folder dialog is open. The folder path is set to C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-stage\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src, and the Select Folder button is highlighted.](media/updated91.png "Select Folder")

4. We are going to introduce a brand new change to Parts Unlimited's website. In the Explorer window, navigate to **src > PartsUnlimitedWebSite > Views > Home** and select **Index.cshtml (4)** for editing. Change the Title of the page **(5)** and save the file by going to the File menu and selecting **Save**. Notice the underlying git repository detecting a change **(6)** in the codebase.

    ![Index.cshtml from src > PartsUnlimitedWebSite > Views > Home folder is open. Page Title is changed to New Home Page. One pending change in the source control is highlighted.](media/vscode-changing-source-code.png "Code editing in VSCode")

5. Select the **Source Control (1)** tab in Visual Studio Code. Since we worked on the codebase in our repo on the virtual machine, the codebase in the repo on GitHub has changed. Open the **Views and more actions... (2)** menu and select **Pull (3)** to get the latest from the remote repository.

    ![Views and more actions... menu is open. Pull command is highlighted.](media/vscode-pull.png "GitHub Pull")

6. Select **Stage Changes (1)**. Type in a commit message **(2)** for the changes. Select **Commit (3)**.

    ![Stage changes button for index.cshtml is highlighted. Commit message is set to New Home Page Title. Commit button is highlighted.](media/vscode-stage-commit.png "GitHub Commit")

7. Open the **Views and more actions... (1)** menu and select **Push (2)** to push the changes to GitHub.

    ![Views and more actions... menu is open. Push command is highlighted.](media/vscode-push.png "GitHub Push")

8. Open the GitHub repository and observe the Actions page for the latest execution of the CI/CD Pipeline.

    ![PartsUnlimited repo is open. Actions page is shown. Successful CI/CD run for the new home page title is highlighted.](media/updated92.png "New commit build")

9. Navigate to the staging environment endpoint in your browser and observe the Title change.

    ![Parts Unlimited staging environment is open in a browser. New Home Page title is highlighted.](media/updated93.png "Parts Unlimited Staging Website")

Now that Parts Unlimited has a separate staging environment for their e-commerce site, they can push new source code and functionality to the repo that will automatically be built and deployed to their staging for testing.

### Task 5: Swap deployment slots to move changes in staging to production

Once Parts Unlimited is happy with the changes tested in their staging environment, they can swap the two environments and have the changes go to production. Environment Swap happens very fast and can help Parts Unlimited pull back changes by switching back if needed.

1. Go back to your lab resource group, navigate to your **partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** **(2)** App Service resource. You can search for `partsunlimited-web` **(1)** to find your app service.

   ![The search box for resources is filled in with partsunlimited-web. The partsunlimited-web-20 Azure App Service is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/updated94.png "Resources")

2. Switch to the **Deployment slots (1)** tab and select **Swap (2)**.

    ![App Service Deployment Slots tab is open. Swap button highlighted.](media/updated95.png "Deployment Slot Swap")

3. Select the **Start Swap** button to swap the staging slot with the production slot.

    ![Deployment Slot Swap dialog is open. Swap button is highlighted.](media/swap.png "Deployment Slot Swap")

4. Once you receive the success message, close the swap panel.

5. Visit both production and staging slot endpoints and observe how the Title change is moved to production.
