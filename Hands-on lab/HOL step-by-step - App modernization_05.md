## Exercise 1: Migrate the on-premises database to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the `ContosoInsurance` database for a migration to Azure SQL Database. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and Azure SQL Database.

> DMA helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality on your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server. To learn more, read the **Data Migration Assistant documentation** here `https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=azuresqldb-mi-current`.

### Task 1: Configure the ContosoInsurance database on the Sql2008-UniqueId VM

Before you begin the assessment, you need to configure the `ContosoInsurance` database on your SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. In this task, you execute a SQL script against the `ContosoInsurance` database on the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance.

> **Note**: There is a known issue with screen resolution when using an RDP connection to Windows Server 2008 R2, which may affect some users. This issue presents itself as very small, hard to read text on the screen. The workaround for this is to use a second monitor for the RDP display, which should allow you to scale up the resolution to make the text larger.

1. Connect to the **Sql2008-UniqueId** Virtual Machine from your lab details page by clicking on **GO TO SQL2008-Uniqueid** button.

   ![The Sql2008-UniqueId virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-App-modernization/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/resources-sql-server-2008-vm.png?raw=true "SQL Server 2008 VM")

2. Once connected to the Sql2008-UniqueId VM, search for ```sql server``` into  Windows Start menu and select **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** from the results and open it.

   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

3. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter **SQL2008-UniqueId** into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

   ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-App-modernization/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/media/local/ssms1.png?raw=true "Connect to Server")

4. Once connected, expand **Databases** under SQL2008-UniqueId in the Object Explorer, and then select **ContosoInsurance** from the list of databases.

   ![The ContosoInsurance database is highlighted in the list of databases.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-App-modernization/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/media/local/ssms2.png?raw=true "Databases")

5. Next, you execute a script in SSMS, which resets the `sa` password, enable mixed mode authentication, create the `WorkshopUser` account, and change the database recovery model to FULL. To create the script, open a new query window in SSMS by selecting **New Query** in the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

6. Copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window:

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    -- SET the sa password
    ALTER LOGIN [sa] WITH PASSWORD=N'Password.1!!';
    GO

    -- Enable Mixed Mode Authentication
    EXEC xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
    N'Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer', N'LoginMode', REG_DWORD, 2;
    GO

    -- Create a login and user named WorkshopUser
    CREATE LOGIN WorkshopUser WITH PASSWORD = N'Password.1!!';
    GO

    EXEC sp_addsrvrolemember
        @loginame = N'WorkshopUser',
        @rolename = N'sysadmin';
    GO

    USE ContosoInsurance;
    GO

    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = N'WorkshopUser')
    BEGIN
        CREATE USER [WorkshopUser] FOR LOGIN [WorkshopUser]
        EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_datareader', N'WorkshopUser'
    END;
    GO

    -- Update the recovery model of the database to FULL
    ALTER DATABASE ContosoInsurance SET RECOVERY FULL;
    GO
    ```

7. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

8. For Mixed Mode Authentication and the new `sa` password to take effect, you must restart the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Service on the Sql2008-UniqueId VM. To do this, you can use SSMS. Right-click the SQL2008-UniqueId instance in the SSMS Object Explorer, and then select **Restart** from the context menu.

    ![In the SSMS Object Explorer, the context menu for the SQL2008-UniqueId instance is displayed, and Restart is highlighted.](media/ssms-object-explorer-restart-sqlserver2008.png "Object Explorer")

9. When prompted about restarting the MSSQLSERVER service, select **Yes**. The service takes a few seconds to restart.

    ![The Yes button is highlighted on the dialog asking if you are sure you want to restart the MSSQLSERVER service.](media/ssms-restart-service.png "Restart MSSQLSERVER service")

### Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

Contoso would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their database to Azure SQL Database. In this task, you use the [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=sql-server-2017) (DMA) to perform an assessment of the `ContosoInsurance` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). Data Migration Assistant (DMA) enables you to upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality on your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. It recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

> **Note**: The Database Migration Assistant has already been installed on your Sql2008-UniqueId VM. It can also be downloaded from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53595).

1. On the Sql2008-UniqueId VM, launch DMA from the Windows Start menu by typing "data migration" into the search bar, and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** in the search results.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/windows-start-menu-dma.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In the DMA dialog, select **+** from the left-hand menu to create a new project.

### Task 4: Retrieve connection information for SQL databases

In this task, you use the Azure Cloud shell to retrieve the IP address of the Sql2008-UniqueId VM, which is needed to connect to your Sql2008-UniqueId VM from DMS.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the Azure Cloud Shell icon from the top menu.

   ![The Azure Cloud Shell icon is highlighted in the Azure portal's top menu.](media/cloud-shell-icon.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

2. In the Cloud Shell window that opens at the bottom of your browser window, select **PowerShell**.

   ![In the Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell window, PowerShell is highlighted.](media/cloud-shell-select-powershell.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

3. Now you need to select **Advanced settings** and specify the subscription, region and resource group for the new storage account as mentioned below: 

   Click on **Show Advanced Settings**.

      ![](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-App-modernization/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/media/local/storage1.png?raw=true.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

   Use exisiting hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group and for:

   - **storage account**: Create new and enter sa{uniqueid}, for example: sa176667.

   - **file share**: Create new and enter fs{uniqueid}, for example: fs176667
 

   ![In the You have no storage mounted dialog, a subscription has been selected, and the Create Storage button is highlighted.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-App-modernization/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/media/local/storage2.png?raw=true "Azure Cloud Shell")

  Then select **Create Storage**.

4. After a moment, a message that you have successfully requested a Cloud Shell appears, and a PS Azure prompt is displayed.

   ![In the Azure Cloud Shell dialog, a message is displayed that requesting a Cloud Shell succeeded, and the PS Azure prompt is displayed.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-App-modernization/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/cloud-shell-ps-azure-prompt.png?raw=true "Azure Cloud Shell")

5. At the prompt, enter the following command, **replacing `<your-resource-group-name>`** with the name resource group:

   ```powershell
   $resourceGroup = "<your-resource-group-name>"
   ```

6. Next, retrieve the public IP address of the Sql2008-uniqueid VM, which is used to connect to the database on that server. Enter and run the following PowerShell command:(Make sure to replace the Uniqueid and run the command)

   ```powershell
   az vm list-ip-addresses -g $resourceGroup -n Sql2008-uniqueid --output table
   ```
- Replace Sql2008-UniqueId with name of your SQLVM. It will look similar to the one as following:
    ```
    az vm list-ip-addresses -g $resourceGroup -n Sql2008-176667 --output table
    ```

   > **Note**: If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, and the account you are using for this hands-on lab is not your default account, you may need to run `az account list --output table` at the Azure Cloud Shell prompt to output a list of your subscriptions, then copy the Subscription Id of the account you are using for this lab, and then run `az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>` to set the appropriate account for the Azure CLI commands.

7. Within the output of the command above, locate and copy the value of the `ipAddress` property within the `publicIPAddresses` object. Paste the value into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe, for later reference.

   ![The output from the az vm list-ip-addresses command is displayed in the Cloud Shell, and the publicIpAddress for the Sql2008-UniqueId VM is highlighted.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-App-modernization/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/cloud-shell-az-vm-list-ip-addresses.png?raw=true "Azure Cloud Shell")

8. Next, run a second command to retrieve the server name of your Azure SQL Database:

   ```powershell
   az sql server list -g $resourceGroup
   ```

   ![The output from the az sql server list command is displayed in the Cloud Shell, and the fullyQualifiedDomainName for the server is highlighted.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-App-modernization/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/local/cloud-shell-az-sql-server-list.png?raw=true "Azure Cloud Shell")

9. Copy the **fullyQualifiedDomainName** value into a text editor for use below.

### Task 5: Migrate the database using the Azure Database Migration Service

At this point, you have migrated the database schema using DMA. In this task, you migrate the data from the `ContosoInsurance` database into the new Azure SQL Database using the Azure Database Migration Service.

> The [Azure Database Migration Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/dms-overview) integrates some of the functionality of Microsoft existing tools and services to provide customers with a comprehensive, highly available database migration solution. The service uses the Data Migration Assistant to generate assessment reports that provide recommendations to guide you through the changes required prior to performing a migration.
