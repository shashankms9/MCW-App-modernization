## Exercise 5: Using serverless Azure Functions to process orders

Duration: 30 minutes

With its migration to Azure, Parts Unlimited plans to launch a series of campaigns to increase its sales. Their current architecture is processing purchase orders synchronously and is coupled with their front end. Parts Unlimited is looking for ways to decouple its order processing system and make sure it can scale independently from the web front end when orders increase.

You suggest a serverless approach that can handle order processing and the creation of invoices for processed orders. In this exercise, you will deploy a serverless Azure Function that will listen to an Azure Storage Queue and process orders as they come. Parts Unlimited has already implemented the changes required to push the jobs into a queue of your choice.

### Task 1: Deploying Azure Functions

1. Connect to your WebVM VM with RDP.

### Task 3: Testing serverless order processing

In this task, we will submit a new order on the Parts Unlimited website and observe the order's processing on the order details page. Once the order is submitted, the web front-end will put a job into an Azure Storage Queue. The Function App that we previously deployed is set to listen to the queue and pull jobs for processing. Once order processing is done, a PDF file will be created, and the link for the PDF file will be accessible on the order details page.

1. Go back to the resource list and navigate to your `partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}` **(2)** App Service resource. You can search for `partsunlimited-web` **(1)** to find your Web App and App Service Plan.

   ![The search box for the resource is filled in with partsunlimited-web. The partsunlimited-web-20 Azure App Service is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/resource-group-appservice-resource.png "Resources")

2. Select **URL** and navigate to the Parts Unlimited web site hosted in Azure App Service.

    ![Parts Unlimited App Service is on screen. URL is highlighted.](media/navigate-to-parts-unlimited-app-service.png "App Service Public Endpoint")

### Task 4: Enable Application Insights on the Function App

In this task, you add Application Insights to your Function App in the Azure Portal, to be able to collect insights related to Function executions.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Function App** by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **parts-func-{uniquesuffix}** App service from the list of resources.
