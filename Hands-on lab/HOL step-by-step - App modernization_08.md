## Exercise 4: Setup CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for the web app

Duration: 55 minutes

In this exercise, you will move the codebase to a GitHub Repo, create a staging environment in Azure App Service using App Service Deployment Slots, and finally connect the pieces with a CI/CD Pipeline built on GitHub Actions.

### Task 1: Moving the codebase to a GitHub repo

1. Login to [GitHub](https://github.com) with your account. Select the New button positioned on top of the repositories list. As an alternative you can [navigate to the new repository site here](https://github.com/new).

    ![GitHub.com Landing page is shown. New button to create a new repository is highlighted.](media/github-new-repo.png "GitHub new repo")

2. Type in `partsunlimited` **(1)** as your repository name. Select **Private (2)** to prevent public access to the repository. Select **Create repository (3)** to continue.

    ![Repository name is set to partsunlimited. Private access is selected. Create repository button is highlighted.](media/github-partsunlimited-repo.png "Create a new repository")

3. Select the **clipboard copy command** to copy the Git endpoint for your repository and paste the value into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe, for later reference.

    ![GitHub repository page is shown. Endpoint copy to clipboard button is highlighted.](media/github-endpoint-copy.png "Repository endpoint")

    So far, we have used the WebVM virtual machine to simulate Parts Unlimited's On-Premises IIS server. Now that we are done with the migration of Parts Unlimited's web site. We will use the VM to execute some development tasks.

4. Connect to your WebVM VM with RDP.

   ![The WebVM virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/webvm-selection.png "WebVM Selection")

5. Right-click on the Windows Start Menu and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** to launch a terminal window.

    ![Start Menu context menu is open. Windows PowerShell (Admin) command is highlighted.](media/launch-powershell.png "Windows PowerShell")

6. The Parts Unlimited website's source code is already copied into the VM as part of the **Before the hands-on lab exercises**. Run the command below to navigate to the source code folder.

    ```powershell
    cd "C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src"
    ```

7. Run the following command to initialize a local Git repository.

    ```powershell
    git init
    ```

    ![PowerShell terminal is shown. Git init is highlighted and executed.](media/git-init.png "Git init")

8. Next, we will define the remote endpoint as an origin to our local repository. Replace `{YourEndpointURL}` with the endpoint URL you copied previously from GitHub. Run the final command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git remote add origin {YourEndpointURL}
    ```

    ![PowerShell terminal is shown. Git remote add origin is highlighted and executed. ](media/git-remote-add.png "Git remote add")

9. Run the following commands to rename current branch to **Main** and add stage all the files for a git commit.

    ```powershell
    git branch -M main
    git add .
    ```

10. Before we commit our changes, we have to identify our git user name and e-mail. In the following command, replace `John Doe` with your name and `johndoe@example.com` with your e-mail address. Once ready, run the command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```

11. We are ready to commit the source code to our local Git repository. Run the following command to continue.

    ```powershell
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    ```

12. Let's push our code to GitHub. Run the following command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git push -u origin main
    ```

13. GitHub authentication screen will pop up. Select **Sign in with your browser (2)**. A new browser pop-up will appear with the GitHub login page.

    ![PowerShell terminal shows git push command and the GitHub Sign In experoence. Sign in with your browser button is highlighted.](media/github-sign-in.png "GitHub Sign In")

14. Fill-in your GitHub account credentials on the browser window to Sign-In.

15. On the **Authorize Git Credential Manager** screen select **Authorize GotCredentialManager**. This will give your local environment permission to push the code to GitHub.

    ![Authorize Git Credential Manager is open. Authorize GotCredentialManager buttin is highligted.](media/github-access.png "Authoriez Git Credential Manager")

16. Close the browser.

17. Go back to GitHub and observe the repository with the source code uploaded.

    ![GitHub shown with the partsunlimited repository populated with source code.](media/github-partsunlimited-repo-loaded.png "GitHub repository page")

### Task 2: Creating a staging deployment slot

1. Go back to your lab resource group, navigate to your `partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}` **(2)** App Service resource. You can search for `partsunlimited-web` **(1)** to find your Web App and App Service Plan

   ![The search box for resources is filled in with partsunlimited-web. The partsunlimited-web-20 Azure App Service is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/resource-group-appservice-resource.png "Resources")

2. Switch to the **Deployment slots (1)** tab and select **Add Slot (2)**.

    ![App Service Deployment Slots tab is open. Add slot button highlighted.](media/app-service-add-deployment-slot.png "Deployment slots")

3. Type in **staging** as the name **(1)** of the new slot. Select your app service name from the **Clone settings from (2)** dropdown list. This will ensure our web site configurations for the production environment are copied over to the staging environment as a starting point. Select **Add (3)** to add the new slot.

    ![Add a slot panel is open. Name is set staging. Partsunlimited-web-20 is selected for the clone settings from dropdown list. Add button is highlighted.](media/app-service-staging-slot.png "Adding deployment slot")

4. Once you receive the success message, close **(1)** the panel. Observe **(2)** the two environments we have for the App Service in the deployment slots list.

    ![Successfully created slot staging message is shown. The close button is highlighted. The current list of slots is presented.](media/app-service-staging-slot-added.png "Deployment slots")

### Task 3: Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

1. Select your staging slot from the list of deployment slots.

    ![Deployment slots are listed. Staging slot named partsunlimited-web-20-staging is highlighted.](media/app-service-staging-select.png "Staging deployment slot")

2. Switch to the **Deployment Center (1)** tab. Select **Go to Settings (2)**.

    ![Deployment Center tab is selected. Go to Settings button is highlighted.](media/app-service-goto-deployment-settings.png "Deployment Center")

3. Select **GitHub (1)** as your source; **.NET Core (2)** as the runtime stack and **.NET Core 2.1 (LTS) (3)** for version. Select **Authorize** to create the connection between the App Service deployment slot and the GitHub repository we previously prepared.

    ![Deployment Settings page is open. Source is set to GitHub. Runtime stack is set to .NET Core. Version is set to .NET Core 2.1 (LTS). Authorize button for GitHub is highlighted. ](media/app-service-deployment-settings.png "Deployment Center Settings")

4. Login with your GitHub credentials and provide authorization to App Service to access the repository by selecting **Authorize AzureAppService**.

    ![Authorize AzureAppService button is highlighted.](media/app-service-github-repo-access.png "Authorize Azure App Service")

5. Once GitHub authorization is complete go back to the browser with the Azure Portal. Select the GitHub **Organization (1)** where you created the GitHub repository. This might be your personal account name if that is where you created the repository. Select the repository **partsunlimited (2)** and the branch **main (3)** as the source for the CI/CD pipeline. Select **Save (4)** to create CI/CD pipeline.

    ![Authorize AzureAppService button is highlighted.](media/app-service-cicd-settings-save.png "Deployment Center Settings")

    Once you select **Save**, the portal will add your App Service publishing profile as a secret to your GitHub repository. This will allow GitHub Actions to publish the Parts Unlimited web site to the staging deployment slot. Additionally, the portal will create a YAML file that describes the steps required to build and publish the code in the partsunlimited repository.

6. Visit your GitHub repository on GitHub.com to look for changes. Navigate to `.github/workflows` **(1)** to see the **YAML file (2)** and the commit **(3)** made to the repository on your behalf.

    ![Partsunlimited repository is open on GitHub.com. .github/workflows folder is shown. A new commit that includes a main_partsunlimited-web-20(staging).yml file is highlighted.](media/github-inital-yaml-commit.png "GitHub Actions worklfow")

7. Select **Actions (1)** to navigate to the Actions page where you can see the list of workflow runs on the repository. Noticed that the latest run has failed **(2)**. Select the failed run (2) to investigate the issue.

    ![GitHub Actions for the repository is open](media/github-actions-failed.png "Github Actions")

8. Select the failed job to dig deeper.

    ![Details for the GitHub workflow run is shown. A failed job named build-and-deploy is highlighted.](media/github-actions-failed-net-core-version.png "GitHub Actions failed build")

9. In the error message, we can see a mismatch between the .NET Core version the build job is using and the one the project is built against. When we set up our CI/CD pipeline, the Azure Portal listed .NET Core LTS (Long Term Support) versions only. Unfortunately, Parts Unlimited uses a .NET Core version that hit the end of life on December 23, 2019. We will have to change our pipeline setup manually to accommodate project requirements.

    ![Build-and-deploy job error message is shown. SDK version requirement 2.2.207 is highlighted.](media/github-actions-version-error.png "Build Error")

10. Select **Code (1)** to switch back to the repository code view. Select **.github/workflows (2)** to navigate to the location where the workflow YAML code is stored.

    ![Partsunlimited GitHub repository root folder is shown. .github/workflows folders are highlighted. ](media/github-navigate-to-yaml.png "GitHub Actions Workflow")

11. Select the YAML file name `main_partsunlimited-web-20(staging).yml`.

    ![The main_partsunlimited-web-20(staging).yml file is highlighted in the GitHub / workflows folder.](media/github-select-yaml-file.png "Workflow YAML")

12. Select the **Edit this file (1)** button to modify the YAML file.

    ![The main_partsunlimited-web-20(staging).yml file is on screen. Edit this file button is highlighted.](media/github-yaml-edit.png "Workflow YAML Editing")

13. We have to change the **dotnet-version (1)** number to `2.2.207`. Additionally, we have to add the solution file name **(2)** and the project file name **(3)** to dotnet build and publish commands. The reason behind this change is the fact that Parts Unlimited has multiple solutions and projects in their codebase.

    ![main_partsunlimited-web-20(staging).yml is open in edit mode. dotnet-version is set to 2.2.207. dotnet build command is changed to include PartsUnlimited.sln as a parameter. dotnet publish command is changed to include src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/PartsUnlimitedWebsite.csproj as a parameter.](media/github-yaml-commit.png "GitHub YAML Editing")

    Here is the final YAML file that you can use if needed.

    ```yaml
    
    # Docs for the Azure Web Apps Deploy action: https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy
    # More GitHub Actions for Azure: https://github.com/Azure/actions
    
    name: Build and deploy ASP.Net Core app to Azure Web App - partsunlimited-web-20(staging)
    
    on:
    push:
        branches:
        - main
    workflow_dispatch:
    
    jobs:
    build-and-deploy:
        runs-on: windows-latest
    
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@master
    
        - name: Set up .NET Core
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
        with:
            dotnet-version: '2.2.207'
    
        - name: Build with dotnet
        run: dotnet build PartsUnlimited.sln --configuration Release
    
        - name: dotnet publish
        run: dotnet publish src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/PartsUnlimitedWebsite.csproj -c Release -o ${{env.DOTNET_ROOT}}/myapp
    
        - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
            app-name: 'partsunlimited-web-20'
            slot-name: 'staging'
            publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AzureAppService_PublishProfile_a00d49c7adc84a028ccc74ff431024d5 }}
            package: ${{env.DOTNET_ROOT}}/myapp
    ```

14. Once all changes are complete select **Start commit (4)**. Type a commit message **(5)**. Select **Commit changes (6)** to submit your changes to the repository.

15. Select **Actions (1)** to switch to the workflows page. Notice the latest successful run **(2)** of our workflow.

    ![Actions on the GitHub Repository is selected. The latest successful run of the workflow is highlighted.](media/github-actions-success.png "GitHub Actions success")

16. Go back to your lab resource group on the Azure Portal, navigate to your `staging (partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}/staging)` **(2)** App Service resource. You can search for `staging` **(1)** to find your App Service (Slot) for staging.

    ![The search box for resources is filled in with staging. The staging (partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}/staging) Azure App Service Deployment Slot is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/select-staging-app-service.png "Staging Resource")

17. Notice the dedicated web link for your staging slot. Select to navigate to the web site to see the result of your successful deployment through the CI/CD pipeline.

    ![Staging slot for partsunlimited app service is open. URL endpont for the deployment slot is highlighted.](media/staging-slot-link.png "Staging public endpoint")

### Task 4: Pushing code changes to staging and production

1. Connect to your WebVM VM with RDP.

   ![The WebVM virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/webvm-selection.png "WebVM Resource Selection")

2. Select the Start menu and search for **Visual Studio Code**. Select **Visual Studio Code** to run it.

    ![Start Menu is open. Visual Studio Code is typed in the search box. Visual Studio Code is highlighted from the list of search results.](media/vscode-start-menu.png "Visual Studio Code")

3. Open the **File (1)** menu and select **Open Folder... (2)**.

    ![File menu is open in Visual Studio Code. Open Folder... command is highlighted.](media/vscode-open-folder.png "Open Folder")

4. Navigate to `C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src` and select **Select Folder (1)**.

    ![Visual Studio Code Open Folder dialog is open. Folder path is set to C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src and Select Folder button is highlighted.](media/vscode-select-folder.png "Select Folder")

5. We are going to introduce a brand new change to Parts Unlimited's web site. In the Explorer window navigate to **src > PartsUnlimitedWebSite > Views > Home** and select **Index.cshtml (4)** for editing. Change the Title of the page **(5)** and save the file by using going to the File menu and selecting **Save**. Notice the underlying git repository detecting a change (6) in the codebase.

    ![Index.cshtml from src > PartsUnlimitedWebSite > Views > Home folder is open. Page Title is changed to New Home Page. One pending change in the source control is highlighted.](media/vscode-changing-source-code.png "Code editing in VSCode")

6. Select **Source Control (1)** tab in Visual Studio Code. Since we worked on the codebase in our repo in the virtual machine, the codebase in the repo on GitHub has changed. Open the **Views and more actions... (2)** menu and select **Pull (3)** to get the latest from the remote repository.

    ![Views and more actions... menu is open. Pull command is highlighted.](media/vscode-pull.png "GitHub Pull")

7. Select **Stage Changes (1)**. Type in a commit message **(2)** for the changes. Select **Commit (3)**.

    ![Stage changes button for index.cshtml is highlighted. Commit message is set to New Home Page Title. Commut button is highlighted.](media/vscode-stage-commit.png "GitHub Commit")

8. Open the **Views and more actions... (1)** menu and select **Push (2)** to push the changes to GitHub.

    ![Views and more actions... menu is open. Push command is highlighted.](media/vscode-push.png "GitHub Push")

9. Open the GitHub repository and observe the Actions page for the latest execution of the CI/CD Pipeline.

    ![PartsUnlimited repo is open. Actions page is shown. Successful CI/CD run for the new home page title is highlighted.](media/github-actions-success-commit.png "New commit build")

10. Navigate to the staging environment endpoint in your browser and observe the Title change.

    ![Parts Unlimited staging environment is open in a browser. New Home Page title is highlighted.](media/staging-code-changes.png "Parts Unlimited Staging Web Site")

Now that Parts Unlimited has a separate staging environment for their e-commerce site, they can push new source code and functionality to the repo that will automatically be built and deployed to their staging for testing.

### Task 5: Swap deployment slots to move changes in staging to production

Once Parts Unlimited is happy with the changes tested in their staging environment, they can swap the two environments and have changes go to production. Environment Swap happens very fast and can help Parts Unlimited pull back changes by switching back if needed.

1. Go back to your lab resource group, navigate to your `partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}` **(2)** App Service resource. You can search for `partsunlimited-web` **(1)** to find your app service.

   ![The search box for resources is filled in with partsunlimited-web. The partsunlimited-web-20 Azure App Service is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/resource-group-appservice-resource.png "Resources")

2. Switch to the **Deployment slots (1)** tab and select **Swap (2)**.

    ![App Service Deployment Slots tab is open. Swap button highlighted.](media/app-service-slot-swap.png "Deployment Slot Swap")

3. Select the **Swap** button to swap the staging slot with the production slow.

    ![Deployment Slot Swap dialog is open. Swap button is highlighted.](media/app-service-slot-swap-panel.png "Deployment Slot Swap")

4. Once you receive the success message, close the swap panel.

5. Visit both production and staging slot endpoints and observe how the Title change is moved to production.

    > Once you move your staging slot to production, your production slot is moved to staging as well. This means that your current staging slot does not have the latest changes you have pushed to the repo. You can trigger a manual CI/CD workflow execution to push the latest changes to staging.
    >
    > To run a CI/CD workflow manually, go to GitHub actions page **(1)** in your repository. Select the workflow **(2)** to run. Open the **Run workflow (3)** menu and select **Run workflow (4)**.
    >
    > ![GitHub Actions page is shown. Build and deploy ASP.Net Core app to Azure Web App - partsunlimited-web-20(staging) workflow is selected. Run workflow menu is open. Run workflow button is highlighted.](media/github-actions-manual-run.png "Manual workflow run")
