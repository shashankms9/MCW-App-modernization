# Exercise 4: Migrate the on-premises database to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 55 minutes

The next step of Part Unlimited's migration project is the assessment and migration of its database. Currently, the database lives on SQL Server 2008 R2 on a virtual machine. You will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment** tool called **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database for migration to Azure SQL Database. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and Azure SQL Database. After the assessment, you will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Migration** service called **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)**. During the exercise, you will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted on virtual machines running on Azure.

## Task 1: Connect to your SqlServer2008 VM with RDP

1. From your lab environment (**WebVM**), in the search bar, **Search** for **RDP** and **select** the **Remote Desktop Connection** app.

2. Paste the **SQLVM DNS Name** in the **Computer** field and click on **Connect**.
   * **SQLVM DNS Name**: **<inject key="SQLVM DNS Name" style="color:blue" />**

   ![](media/rdp-vm2.png)  
 
3. Now, enter the SQLVM **username**, and **password** provided below and then click on the **Ok** button. Please add the **dot** and **back-slash** “.\” before the username.
   * **username**: **<inject key="SQLVM Username" style="color:blue" />** 
   * **password**: **<inject key="SQLVM Password" style="color:blue" />**

## Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their database to Azure SQL Database. In this task, you will use the [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=sql-server-2017) (DMA) to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). Data Migration Assistant (DMA) enables you to upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality on your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. It recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

> **Note**: The Database Migration Assistant is already installed on your Lab (Web) VM. If not found, it can be downloaded through Azure Migrate or from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090807) as well, and as Data Migration Assistant is dependent on .NET Framework 4.8 download and install .Net Framework from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2085155) and **restart** the VM before you install Data Migration Assistant.

1. Launch DMA from the Windows Start menu by typing **"data migration" (1)** into the search bar, and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (2)** from the search results.

    > **Note**: There is a known issue with screen resolution when using an RDP connection to Windows Server 2008 R2, which may affect some users. This issue presents itself as very small, hard to read text on the screen. The workaround for this is to use a second monitor for the RDP display, which should allow you to scale up the resolution to make the text larger.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/updated37.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In the DMA dialog, select **+** from the left-hand menu to create a new project.
