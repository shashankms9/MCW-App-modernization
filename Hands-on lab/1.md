# Exercise 1: Review the Legacy On-Prem Application

Duration: 10 minutes

In this lab, we have provisioned a web application called **Parts Unlimited**. It is an ASP.NET two-tier application that runs on a Windows server with the SQL server back-end and web server front-end.

1. On the Microsoft Edge browser window, enter **localhost** and you will be redirected to the Parts Unlimited web application hosted on the web server.

2. Go through the web application. We will be migrating this web application from on-prem to Azure in further exercises.

3. From the provided VM, in the search bar, **Search** for **RDP** and **select** the **Remote Desktop Connection** app.
